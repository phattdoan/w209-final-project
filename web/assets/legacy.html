						<h2>Forging a Legacy</h2>
						<p>The Silicon Valley economy surpasses GDP of many nations. Technology giants Apple and Google collectively employ almost 40,000 people in the South Bay Area and can be credited with much of the income generated. It is important to remember, however, that other tech firms including Intel, Cisco, Adobe, Hewlett Packard, Advanced Micro Devices, and Lockheed Martin continue to contribute to the South Bay’s economy. Not to mention the engineering firms like, Salas O’Brien Engineering and URS Corporation, who benefit from the area’s continued growth. See how the Silicon Valley economy has grown over the years, and imagine where it can go from here.
