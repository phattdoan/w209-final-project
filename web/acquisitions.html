						<h2>Acquisitions</h2>
				
					</header>
					<p>An acquisition is the purchase of one company by another in which no new company is formed. Acquisitions are a part of the daily Silicon Valley environment. Acquisitions can be a way to grow business, add more products, or add more customers. They can also allow founders to cash out or become a part of a larger company. Sometimes, the combination of two companies forms a new company, and this is termed a “merger”. <br /></p>
					<p>Identify the biggest giants that are the byproducts of very many companies. Cisco leads this game with 194 acquisitions to date. Google is not far behind. Use the information from the bottom graphs to learn additional details, such as the companies acquired, the industries the acquired companies belonged to, the amount companies were acquired for, the the geographical location of the acquired companies. The rise of Silicon Valley has affected the many parts of the country, coast to coast.
